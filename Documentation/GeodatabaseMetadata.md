## Geodatabase Feature Class Metadata Descriptions

Tabulation of level abbreviations by geography and ACS category characteristics. The 3-letter abbreviation consists of:

* First and second letter: *Geography level* (14-levels)
* Third letter: *ACS category characteristics* (4-levels)

*Total abbreviations: 14 georaphies x 4 characteristics = 56 feature class levels (four in each geodatabase).*
